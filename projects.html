          <p>This project dives into movie genres to understand their trends and success factors. Using IMDb data, I analyzed which genres are the most common, which ones bring in the most money, and which are the most popular. I also explored how budget and ratings impact a movieâ€™s success. Through data visualization and analysis, I uncovered key insights about the film industry, helping to see what makes certain genres stand out financially and critically.</p>

          <p>This **Call Center KPI Dashboard** provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor and improve call center efficiency. It visualizes crucial metrics such as **call volume, average handling time, customer satisfaction, agent performance, and resolution rates**, enabling managers to make data-driven decisions. By analyzing trends and identifying bottlenecks, this dashboard helps optimize resource allocation, enhance customer experience, and improve overall operational performance. Designed with **clear visuals and interactive elements**, it serves as a valuable tool for call center management to track real-time performance and drive continuous improvement.</p>

          <p>This Kaggle notebook explores a natural language processing (NLP) approach to extracting students' interests from their personal stories. By leveraging text analysis techniques such as tokenization, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis, the model identifies patterns and key themes in students' narratives to determine their areas of interest. Implementation involves preprocessing the text data, applying NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy, and using machine learning or rule-based methods to categorize interests. This can be applied in educational settings to personalize learning experiences, career counseling, and student engagement initiatives.</p>

          <p>This Zumo bot is a color-responsive line-following robot that adapts its movement based on surface reflections. Equipped with color sensors, it follows a designated path while dynamically adjusting its speed. When it detects black, it accelerates, and when it sees white, it decelerates, continuously responding to color changes in real-time. This behavior allows the bot to navigate efficiently while demonstrating interactive and adaptive motion control, making it ideal for robotics experiments and automation projects.</p>
